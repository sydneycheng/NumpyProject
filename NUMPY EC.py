# Write a script to play two-dimensional Tic-Tac-Toe between a human player 
# and the computer. Use a 3-by-3 two-dimensional array. Each player indicates 
# their moves by entering a pair of numbers representing the row and column indices 
# of the square in which they want to place their mark, either an 'X' or an 'O'. 
# When the first player moves, place an 'X' in the specified square. With the 
# computer choice, place an 'O' in the specified square. Each move must be to an 
# empty square. After each move, determine whether the game has been won and whether 
# itâ€™s a draw. Also, allow the player to specify whether he or she wants to go first 
# or second.
